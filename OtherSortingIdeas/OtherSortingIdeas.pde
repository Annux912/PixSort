OTHER SORTING IDEAS
Jeff Thompson | 2013 | www.jeffreythompson.org

Ideas for pixel-sorting projects:

1  Intentionally bad seam sorting; looks for WORST possible path through an image, sorts by that!

2  Swap color values (r > g, g > b, b > r)

3  Draw a line across screen (must hit top/bottom), sort by that; alternatively, use neighboring
   method to expand like tracing a leaf

4  All values where red is largest value in color - sort; repeat for green and blue

5  Sort red, green, and blue values separately (re-organizes on a more atomistic level)
